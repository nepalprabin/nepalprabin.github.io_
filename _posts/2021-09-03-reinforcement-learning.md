## What is Reinforcement Learning
We are constantly learning new things by interacting with the environment. This is a natural behaviour of animals and people to learn by interacting wth the environment.
A new born child adapts the environment constantly by interacting with it. He/She get to know the things in his/her way without the help of any external agent. For example,
a child taking his/her finger near to the fire for the first time, he/she feels the warmth of the fire and get to know that if we go near it, then there can be negative consequences.
This way a child learns gradually while interacting with the environment. So, in other terms reinforcement learning enables agent to learn through consequence of actions in a
specific environment.
