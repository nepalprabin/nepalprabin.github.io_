# Part of Speech Tagging
> This is my brief note from *DeepLearning.AI's* [NLP Specialization Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing).

Part of Speech is the category of words or the the lexical terms in a language. Some of them are: 
  - noun
  - verb
  - adjective
  - pronoun
  - adverb and others

Consider a sentence: Why not learn something? This sentence can be represented in terms of part of speech where <code>why</code> can be categorized as <code>adverb</code>, <code>learn as </code>verb</code>, <code>something</code> as noun and so on.

During analysing large corpus of text, writing all these lexical terms may be cumbersome, so we write short form of these terms referring it as POS (Part of Speech).

## So, what is POS tagging?
Part of Speech tagging simply means assigning these tags to the word of a sentence or a corpus. POS tagging is applied in various areas of machine learning tasks such as:
  - Named entites
  - Co-reference resoultion
  - Speech recognition
