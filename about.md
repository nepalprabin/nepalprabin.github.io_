# About

I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Specialization) at the [University of South Dakota](https://www.usd.edu/arts-and-sciences/computer-science/graduate). I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer focusing on Computer Vision. I am currently working on Computer Vision (with little intersection of NLP). Besides this, I use JavaScript(Nodejs and Vuejs) for Full Stack Development.

Major interests:

- Software architecture
- Python
- Artificial Intelligence
- Medical Imaging
- Self-supervised Learning
- Learning new languages

My working philosophies:

- Communication and collaboration with other developers and stakeholders is the key to a successful project
- Use of right tool for the job. A programming language is just a tool!
- Make yourself better everyday
### - Most important: Believe in yourself (The power to conquer the world is with in you!!


### Besides programming I am interested in sports (football and cricket) and reading novels.
