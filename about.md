# About

I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Specialization) at the [University of South Dakota](https://www.usd.edu/arts-and-sciences/computer-science/graduate). I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer focusing on Computer Vision. I am currently working on Computer Vision (with little intersection of NLP). Besides this, I use JavaScript(Nodejs and Vuejs) for Full Stack Development.

Major interests:

- Software architecture
- Python
- Artificial Intelligence
- Medical Imaging
- Self-supervised Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Learning new languages
